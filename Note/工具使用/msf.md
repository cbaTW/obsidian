Basic Field:: Value
**Bold Field**:: Nice!
You can also write [field:: inline fields]; multiple [field2:: on the same line].
If you want to hide the (field3:: key), you can do that too.

```dataview
TABLE 
file.day AS "如果本來裡面就有時間", 
file.cday as "創建時間", 
file.mtime AS "修改日期", 
status AS "都行" 
FROM "Tool"
```
